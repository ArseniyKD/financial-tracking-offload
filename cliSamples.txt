### First, the basic top level options:

> Add Transactions - Adds transactions to the current month

> See Summary - Queries the sheet for the latest financial summary data

> New Month - Creates a new sheet with the name provided and changes the month.
 
> Change Current Month - Changes the current month tab that we will write to and read from.

> Migrate Old Sheets - Takes the file path with the old sheets directory and shifts it over.

> Exit - Self explanatory :)

### Let's think through each CLI

## Add Transactions

Let's give three options:
  1) Add a single transaction, comma separated.
  2) Batch add transactions, each value in the transaction is comma separated.
     Will run in a loop with a "done" and "cancel" options at each iteration.
  3) Go back to main menu.

The general idea is to present a sample transaction in the right format, then
allow the "user" specify everything they want.

## See Summary

Only one option, as the summary is simple. Print the two tables, one for per
category summary, and the other is the aggregate summaries with deductions.

Once printed, provide an option to go back to the main menu.

## New Month

Takes as input the month string. We should have a validation function that
verifies that we are not creating duplicates, as that is going to be problematic.

## Change Current Month

Changes the current month used in all the other CLI commands to the user provided
string. Validation function needs to make sure that the month is actually in the
list of months that we have.

## Migrate old sheets

Takes a path from the user, and calls the script in the core logic to just do
the migration.
